  <h1>Even Spacing Feature - Manual Test Guide</h1>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> This page is for testing the even spacing snap-to feature.
    Load this page with the Box Highlight extension enabled.
  </div>

  <h2>Test Scenario 1: Horizontal Even Spacing (Between)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Press <code>D</code> to enable drawing mode</li>
    <li>Draw two rectangles with a horizontal gap between them:
      <ul>
        <li>Rectangle A: anywhere on the left side</li>
        <li>Rectangle B: to the right of A with a noticeable gap</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Draw a third rectangle C and drag it between A and B</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> When C is positioned to create equal spacing on both sides, it should snap and show a vertical guide line in the gap between A and C (or C and B)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 1b: Horizontal Even Spacing (Right)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>With the same two rectangles A and B from above</li>
    <li>Draw a third rectangle C and drag it to the RIGHT of B</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> When C is positioned so the gap between B and C equals the gap between A and B, it should snap and show a vertical guide line in the gap between B and C</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> <code>[A] gap [B] gap [C]</code> with equal gaps</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 1c: Horizontal Even Spacing (Left)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>With the same two rectangles A and B</li>
    <li>Draw a third rectangle C and drag it to the LEFT of A</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> When C is positioned so the gap between C and A equals the gap between A and B, it should snap and show a vertical guide line in the gap between C and A</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> <code>[C] gap [A] gap [B]</code> with equal gaps</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 2: Vertical Even Spacing (Between)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw two rectangles with a vertical gap:
      <ul>
        <li>Rectangle A: anywhere at the top</li>
        <li>Rectangle B: below A with a noticeable gap</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Draw a third rectangle C and drag it between A and B</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> When positioned for equal spacing, it should snap and show a horizontal guide line in the gap between A and C (or C and B)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 2b: Vertical Even Spacing (Below)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>With the same two rectangles A and B from above</li>
    <li>Draw a third rectangle C and drag it BELOW B</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> When C is positioned so the gap between B and C equals the gap between A and B, it should snap and show a horizontal guide line in the gap between B and C</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> <code>[A] gap [B] gap [C]</code> vertically with equal gaps</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 2c: Vertical Even Spacing (Above)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>With the same two rectangles A and B</li>
    <li>Draw a third rectangle C and drag it ABOVE A</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> When C is positioned so the gap between C and A equals the gap between A and B, it should snap and show a horizontal guide line in the gap between C and A</li>
    <li><strong>Pattern:</strong> <code>[C] gap [A] gap [B]</code> vertically with equal gaps</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 3: Duplication with Even Spacing</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw two rectangles with a gap</li>
    <li>Draw a third rectangle anywhere on the page</li>
    <li>Hold <code>Alt</code> and click on the third rectangle to duplicate it</li>
    <li>Drag the duplicate between the first two rectangles</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> Even spacing snap should work during duplication</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 4: Repositioning with Even Spacing</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw three rectangles (any arrangement)</li>
    <li>Hold <code>Cmd/Ctrl</code> and click on one rectangle to reposition it</li>
    <li>Drag it to create even spacing with other rectangles</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> Even spacing snap should work during repositioning</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 5: Priority (Edge Alignment vs Even Spacing)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw two rectangles with a gap</li>
    <li>Position a third rectangle so it would both:
      <ul>
        <li>Align with the edge of one rectangle</li>
        <li>Create even spacing between the two rectangles</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> Edge alignment should take priority over even spacing (edge guides shown, not spacing guides)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Test Scenario 6: Rectangle Too Large</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw two rectangles very close together (small gap)</li>
    <li>Try to drag a large rectangle between them</li>
    <li><strong>Expected:</strong> No even spacing snap should occur if the rectangle doesn't fit with room for spacing</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>What to Look For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spacing guide appearance:</strong> Solid colored line (not dashed) using the extension's accent color</li>
    <li><strong>Spacing guide position:</strong> Line appears at the midpoint of the gap</li>
    <li><strong>Spacing guide length:</strong> Line spans only the gap region, not the full viewport</li>
    <li><strong>Snap behavior:</strong> Rectangle snaps smoothly when positioned for even spacing</li>
    <li><strong>Guide disappears:</strong> Spacing guide disappears when you move away from even spacing position</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Use <code>?</code> to open the shortcuts dialog and verify "Snap to Edges" is enabled in settings.
